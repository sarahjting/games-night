# Games Night

This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis!

> "Who starts?"
> "Whoever won last week."
> "Who was that again?"

> "Who's washing the dishes?"
> "Whoever lost the last game."
> "Who remembers that?"

Ever ran into this scenario? Not anymore! This app keeps track of your games nights and your scoreboards, so your losers have no more excuses for forgetting to bring drinks in the next week.
